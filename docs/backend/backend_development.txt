# Antique Finder App - Backend Development Plan

## Overview

The backend for the Antique Finder application will provide RESTful API services for the mobile client. It will handle user authentication, listing management, messaging, location-based discovery, and merchant-specific functionality. The backend will be built using Node.js with Express and will store data in MongoDB.

## Core Requirements

1. **Authentication System**
   - User registration (buyers and sellers)
   - Login/logout
   - Password reset
   - JWT-based authentication

2. **User Management**
   - User profiles
   - Preference settings
   - Location management

3. **Listing Management**
   - CRUD operations for listings
   - Image upload and storage
   - Filtering and searching
   - Location-based discovery

4. **Offer System**
   - Create and manage offers on items
   - Negotiation functionality

5. **Messaging System**
   - Conversation management between users
   - Message storage and retrieval
   - Read receipts

6. **Merchant Dashboard**
   - Inventory analytics
   - Offer tracking
   - Performance metrics

7. **Monetization**
   - Ad integration endpoints
   - Subscription management
   - Featured listings

## Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 or similar cloud storage
- **Geospatial**: MongoDB geospatial queries
- **Validation**: Joi or similar
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

## Database Schema Design

See the database schema in the main documentation. We'll implement MongoDB schemas matching those definitions.

## API Endpoints Implementation Plan

We'll implement the API endpoints as defined in the main documentation, focusing on the core functionality first.

## Development Approach

We'll develop the backend in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Project setup
- Database connection
- Authentication system
- Basic CRUD for users and listings

### Phase 2: Discovery & Interaction
- Location-based discovery
- Offer system
- Basic search and filtering

### Phase 3: Communication
- Messaging system
- Notifications framework

### Phase 4: Merchant Features
- Dashboard endpoints
- Analytics
- Inventory management

### Phase 5: Monetization
- Subscription endpoints
- Featured listings
- Ad integration points

## Implementation Status

| Folder/Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| `/config` | Not Started | Configuration files for environment variables, database, etc. |
| `/models` | Not Started | MongoDB schemas and models |
| `/controllers` | Not Started | Route handlers |
| `/routes` | Not Started | API route definitions |
| `/middleware` | Not Started | Authentication middleware, error handlers, etc. |
| `/services` | Not Started | Business logic separated from controllers |
| `/utils` | Not Started | Utility functions |
| `/server.js` | Not Started | Main server file |

## Security Considerations

- Input validation on all endpoints
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- CORS configuration
- JWT token expiration and refresh strategy
- Environment variable protection
- MongoDB injection prevention

## Performance Considerations

- Index design for MongoDB
- Query optimization
- Pagination for listing endpoints
- Cache strategy for common queries
- Optimize image storage and retrieval

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for service functions
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Load testing for performance validation
- Security testing

## Deployment Strategy

- Development environment setup
- Staging environment
- Production deployment plan
- CI/CD pipeline
- Monitoring and logging setup
